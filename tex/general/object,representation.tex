\section{Object representation}

In the previous section we discussed how to propagate a light field through an 
optical system.  For some applications, \eg{} light field estimation from
plenoptic or focal stack measurements~\cite{}, the techniques in the previous
section are sufficient.  On the other hand, to model objects (and their light
fields) independently from how measurements are acquired, we need new tools.
