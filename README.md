# Light field reconstruction

This is the project directory for Madison McGaffin's work related to light
fields.

# Building

Everything in the project can be built by running `make` in the project 
root directory.  This will build code, generate figures that are easy to
regenerate, etc.

# On Python

This project uses a bunch of Python code.  The easiest way to get started 
is to set up a virtual environment; a copy of the `virtualenv` project is
shipped with this project in the `py` directory.
